# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Notes

I had a pretty difficult time writing the JS code for this assignment. I particularly struggled with writing the timer and the timer functions, but I gradually made progress with the questions and onclick functions. It took a lot of time before the JS code started making sense, so I did not have much time to flesh out the css properties. However, I feel as if I had a solid grasp on that aspect of the assignment and I could make the quiz look a little prettier given more time. 



## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
